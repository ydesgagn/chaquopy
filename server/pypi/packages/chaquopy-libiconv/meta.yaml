# The iconv functions were added to the Android libc in API level 28. On devices of that
# version or newer, the libc implementation will be used, even by libraries which are
# explicitly linked to libiconv. This is because of the default symbol resolution order, as
# documented in the dlopen man page.
#
# Unfortunately this may cause some loss of functionality, as the Android libc implementation
# only supports UTF-8, 16 and 32
# (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/libc/bionic/iconv.cpp). This could
# be worked around by changing the importer to use RTLD_DEEPBIND, but that might have undesired
# effects on other packages, so it would have to be tested thoroughly.
